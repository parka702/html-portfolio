<h1>Hi, I’m Patricia - a future web developer in the making</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to my portfolio! I’m currently taking my first steps into the world of web development, 
  and this site is both a reflection of my learning journey and a space where I can showcase what I’m working on.
</p>

<p>
  I started learning HTML as my foundation, and I’m gradually expanding my skills to include CSS, JavaScript, and eventually more advanced technologies. 
  I’m following an online course on Udemy, studying in my spare time, and really enjoying the process of building things from scratch. 
  There’s something incredibly rewarding about writing code and seeing it come to life in the browser.
</p>

<p>
  What I love about web development is how it blends creativity with structure. 
  It’s not just about writing lines of code—it’s about problem-solving, design, user experience, and constant learning. 
  That’s what excites me the most. I’m passionate about creating things that are not only functional but also visually engaging and user-friendly.
</p>

<p>
  Even though I’m at the beginning of my journey, I’m fully committed to growing my skills and eventually building a career in tech. 
  This portfolio will evolve along with me—so if you’re curious, feel free to check back from time to time to see what I’ve been working on.
</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
